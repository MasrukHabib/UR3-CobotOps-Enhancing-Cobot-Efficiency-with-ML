## 🔍 Techniques Explored
The following ML models were implemented and tested as part of this project:

### 📈 ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Used for time series forecasting to predict maintenance schedules and detect anomalies in cobot operations.

### 🧠 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Implemented to capture sequential patterns in sensor data for more accurate predictive insights.

### 📊 K-Means Clustering
Applied to categorize different operational states of the cobot for better state monitoring and performance optimization.

### ✅ Classification Models
Used to predict the likelihood of specific errors or faults occurring based on historical data.
